Divvy Bike Sharing Analysis for Chicago

Welcome to the Divvy Bike Sharing Analysis project repository! This project dives into the micro-mobility landscape of Chicago, focusing on the operations and utilization of the Divvy bike sharing system. Through exploratory data analysis, Origin-Destination (OD) matrix generation, geographical mapping, and cost-benefit estimation, we aim to gain insights into the dynamics of bike sharing in the Windy City.

Overview
This project encompasses various aspects of Divvy bike sharing analysis, including:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the patterns and trends in bike usage over time.
- OD Matrix Generation: Creating origin-destination matrices to analyze trip flows.
- Age Group Analysis: Segmenting users by age to uncover demographic insights.
- Geospatial Mapping: Visualizing bike stations, routes, and usage patterns using QGIS.
- Utilization Percentage Calculation: Determining the efficiency and utilization rate of bikes.
- Cost-Benefit Estimation: Assessing the economic impact and viability of the bike sharing system.
